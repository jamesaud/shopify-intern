# Purpose 

Flask microservice for the shopify internship challenge. Design a REST API that functions as a minimal online store. 

# Development tools

Developed in flask with docker. Flask_rest_plus is used (https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for optimal Swagger.io integration (https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

# Getting started

`docker-compose up`

The webserver should be running on localhost:8000
